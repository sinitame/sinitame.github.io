This trip started 4 months before taking off! The plan was to find the best place (not to expensive, exotic and with a lot of places to dicover) to spend our christmas holidays with my girlfriend and another friend. After many hours spent on Facetime we finally decided to plan a roadtrip to Mexico as the country was very beautiful, rather cheap and seemed to have amazing places to discover.

We carefully planned our road trip to see different places and to spend enough time in each cities to enjoy the place and to catch its spirit during our two weeks stay.
