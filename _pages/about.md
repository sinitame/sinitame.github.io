I graduated from Grenoble INP ENSIMAG with a major in embedded systems and
software devices. In addition to that major, I studied machine learning and data science
during an academic exchange at the Ecole polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Lausanne.

Always eager to put into practice my skills into real projects, I did a lot of interships during
my studies. Here are some examples of the projects I've worked on during those:

* **Convolutional neural Network accelearation on FPGA:** During my first 6 months
internship, I worked at Atos R&D center at Echirolles (near Grenoble). I studied
the implementation of an FPGA accelerator for inference with my tutor Alban
Bourge. I was mainly focused on the design of an automatic network generator
flow using Python. From a CNN stored in ONNX format, the tool was able to
generate an optimized hardware architecture of the network on the FPGA from
generic blocks. The solution achieved state of the art results on some simple
CNN architecture. *I co-authored a patent on our solution with the team*

* **Optimizing heterogeneous acceleration pipeline:** During my second internship,
I worked at IBM Power Systems lab in Montpellier. I worked on the design and the
implementation of massive data acquisition and processing pipeline using FPGAs
and GPUs on Power9 servers. I was focused on the optimization of data exchanges
beteen a FPGA and a GPU using IBM Coherent Accelerator Processor Interface
(CAPI) and NVIDIA NVLINK technology to maximize throughtputs in the pipeline.
*I made some open-source contributions to the SNAP framework developped by IBM
teams and available on GitHub*


I'm now a Machine Learning Engineer at Sonos where I work on On Device Speech Recognition.
